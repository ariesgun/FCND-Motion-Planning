# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`

`motion_planning.py` provides the implementation of loading the environment data, calling the planning function in `planning_utils.py`, and executing the flying plan. Here the state changes from arming the drone, flying the drone, and stopping the drone can be found in this file.

`planning_utils.py` contains the implementation for the planning algorithm and loading the 2D environment. 
These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes...

And here's a lovely image of my results (ok this image has nothing to do with it, but it's a nice example of how to include images in your writeup!)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
It can be achieved by opening the file itself and the read the first line.
Later the information is splitted and parsed to both longitude and latitude.

Then use the Drone API to set its global home position. 

#### 2. Set your current local position
This is achieved by using `global_to_local` function.

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
This is how it is implemented.
```
loc_north, loc_east = (int(np.ceil(local_position[0])), int(np.ceil(local_position[1])))
grid_start = (loc_north - north_offset, loc_east - east_offset)
```

This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!

#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
Setting the grid goal position is converted first into local position using `global_to_local_position` function. 

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
The diagonal motions with a cost of sqrt(2) are added in `planning_utils.py`.

#### 6. Cull waypoints 
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.


### Execute the flight
#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

### Double check that you've met specifications for each of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) points.
  
# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
